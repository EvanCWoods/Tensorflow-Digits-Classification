# Tensorflow-Digits-Classification

This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the mnist dataset with an accuracy no less than 99%.
The project will include tensorflow sequential models that increase in complexity on each new iteration. This will start from a basic architecture neural network and increase to a more complex convolutional neural network to leverage feature extraction for increased accuracy.
